#This notebook is meant to create a classifier for classifying wheat seeds into three classes (i.e., species): Kama, Rosa and Canadian encoded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively

# Import the libraries for loading the data, for splitting the data into train and test
# sets and for creating a KNN classifier.                                                   [3 Marks]
